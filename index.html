				<h1>Resumé</h1>
				<p> I currently study Digital Data Strategy at Hyper Island in Stockholm.

Now, however I'm all about tracking conversion and creating digital strategies for companies growth.

				When I'm not working on exciting projects, I practice Thai- and Kick Boxing, which is my way to handle a hectic life style at the same time socialising, coaching others and being coached. I also love skiing and hiking which are hobbies I try to pursue at least a couple of days a year. Apart from fighting and being out in the nature, I enjoy traveling and experiencing new music, movies, food, drinks and what not. </p>
