				<p> My name is Mika Derkert and I am a Digital Strategist and Concept Developer with experience and knowledge within digital marketing, strategy, communication, strategic design, branding, and user experience.
				<p>
				I would say that my key strengths are digital strategy, branding, UX and concept development. I create everything from marketing- and growth strategies, to concepts and brand positioning strategies. 
				<p>
				I have worked with marketing and communication for both B2C and B2B. And have experience from different industries, ranging from fashion to construction. 
				<p>
				Through having experience from both design and digital strategy I have gotten a holistic view of marketing and communication, and have an understanding of different roles within the communication industry.
				<p>
				<b>Key strengths:</b>
				<br>
				– Digital Marketing and Strategy
				<br>
				– Brand positioning strategy
				<br>
				– Design and user experience
				<br>
				– Design processes and methods
				<br>
				– Presenting and pitching
				<p>
				When I'm not working, I like to excercise – I practice both yoga, cross training and kickboxing. I also love skiing and hiking which are hobbies I try to pursue at least a couple of times a year. Apart from kickboxing and being out in nature, I enjoy travelling and finding new music, movies, food, and so on. </p>
