				  	<span class="underline">Hyper Island Project: Data Landscape</span>
				</h3>
				<p> <b> About the project </b>  
				<br>
				This was the first project at Hyper Island – during 5 weeks, me and my team worked with the cloud collaboration platform Dropbox. We did research and analysed the business model and  strategy, in order to come up with at least four hypotheses on how the company could grow, based on data and research. 
				<p>
				<b> We spent five weeks working with: </b> 
				<br>
				– Mapping the business model and strategy
				<br>
				– KPI's and target goals 
				<br>
				– Customer journeys 
				<br>
				– Growth hypotheses, and gathering data that support the hypotheses
				<br>
				– Tests to validate the hypotheses
				<br>
				– Estimating costs and gains of the the best growth hypothesis
				<p>
				<p>

				<h1>"It is all word of mouth. Most of our business comes to us." – Dennis Woodside, COO at Dropbox</h1>				
				<p>
				<b> Growth Tactic </b> 
				<br>
				The hypothesis that we belived would have the biggest impact was a collaboration with Wework, where a free Dropbox account would be included in Wework's offer. This would increase awareness about the service and help Dropbox reach relevant target groups such as start-ups, freelancers and remote workers. This tactic would also support their overall communication strategy to spread awareness through word of mouth.
